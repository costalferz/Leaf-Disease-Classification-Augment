## Requirement
We run code in Google Colab
- Python 3.10.12
- PyTorch 2.0.1
- NVIDIA Tesla T4

## Dataset
Here we have use Durian Leaf Disease dataset. The dataset original consists of 420 healthy and disease leaf images divided into 4 class by disease.

Dataset can be found [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/new-workspace-7ly0p/durian-diseases)

The classes uses in dataset are:
- Leaf Spot
- Algal Leaf Spot
- Leaf Blight 
- No Disease

## Augmentation

durian plant disease with augmentation by rotation and cutout methods in roboflow 
90Â° Rotate: Clockwise, Counter-Clockwise, Upside Down
Cutout: 7 boxes with 15% size each

Dataset Split: Train 70 %, Valid 15 %, Test 15 %


> Dataset No Augmentation can be download [here](https://app.roboflow.com/ds/jcFfz9CvlR?key=OZ6mrOsC6S).
